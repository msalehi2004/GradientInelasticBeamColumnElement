More details on the column dimensions/properties could be found in Sideris and Salehi (2016).

The OpenSees model is defined in the Tcl files named "Prameters" and "RC_column."
The text file "cyclic" contains the applied lateral displacement history.
The Matlab file "plotData" may be used to plot selected model results.
